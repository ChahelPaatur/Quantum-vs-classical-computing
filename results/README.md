# Benchmark Results

This directory contains the results from running the quantum vs classical vs hybrid computing benchmark. Below is an explanation of the output files:

## CSV Files

- `metrics_comparison.csv`: A comprehensive comparison of all metrics across all models.

## Visualization Files

- `accuracy_comparison.png` (classification) or `r2_comparison.png` (regression): Comparison of the primary accuracy metric across all models.
- `time_comparison.png`: Comparison of model execution times.
- `practicality_comparison.png`: Comparison of practical aspects of each model.
- `radar_comparison.png`: Multi-dimensional comparison of all performance metrics.
- `comprehensive_dashboard.png`: A complete dashboard with all metrics visualized together.

## Interpreting the Results

### Performance Metrics

- **Accuracy/RÂ²**: Higher is better. This measures how well the model predicts the target values.
- **Execution Time**: Lower is better. This measures how long it takes to train the model.
- **Inference Time**: Lower is better. This measures how long it takes to make predictions.
- **Memory Usage**: Lower is better. This measures how much memory the model requires.

### Practicality Metrics

- **Setup Difficulty**: Higher is better. This measures how easy it is to set up the model.
- **Interpretability**: Higher is better. This measures how easy it is to understand the model.
- **Deployment Complexity**: Higher is better. This measures how easy it is to deploy the model.
- **Hardware Requirements**: Higher is better. This measures how accessible the required hardware is.
- **Scalability**: Higher is better. This measures how well the model scales to larger problems.

## Comparing the Models

- **Classical Models**: Traditional machine learning models (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Neural Networks).
- **Quantum Models**: Models that use quantum computing principles (using frameworks like Qiskit and PennyLane).
- **Hybrid Models**: Models that combine classical and quantum approaches in different ways.

The benchmark provides a holistic view of how these different computing paradigms compare across various dimensions, helping you understand the trade-offs between them for different types of machine learning tasks.
